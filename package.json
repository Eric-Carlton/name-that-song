  "description": "A game that generates a 200 song playlist based on a randomly selected user's input of an artist.  10 songs are randomly selected from the playlist.  A 30 second clip of each song is played.  All users may input a guess for the song name and artist of the song being played to get points.  Correct guesses are awarded 1 point, incorrect guesses cost the player one point.  The first player to 5 points ( must win by two points ) is declared the winner.  If there is no winner at the end of the first user's playlist, another user is picked to choose an artist.  The process continues until a user has won.",
